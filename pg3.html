    <pre>for the first 2 years of college
                        I was in community college and did a very small amount of programming 
                                                                                       but nothing major other than getting 
                                                                                                        my first taste of python (the worst language i have ever used).
                                                                                                                                    after graduating community college and getting into OSU,
                                                                               I was back to Java for my first 2 semesters.
                               then I finally got to
                                                    learn new languages,
                                                                             C and Assembly.
                                                                                                          C wasnt the worst because it is relatively
                                                                        similar to Java syntax wise,
                                                   but if learning C after
                      knowing Java is like learning French after
    already being fluent in Italian,
                                    learning Assembly is like learning Japanese.
