                I like the chaotic elements of these, and the very simplistic designs. I also want to try to manipulate the positioning of elements as much as possible.
                It’s hard to make a mockup because what I want to do is easier to just do as I go,
                    but I want to make something similar to the first link where there’s lots of buttons and checkboxes that link to stuff, but with labeling for each section.
                I also want to have specific pages that look like the declin sequence site, where everything is moving and changing.
                This is a basic mockup of the home page idea.
