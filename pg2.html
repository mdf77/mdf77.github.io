    <h1>It started in high school</h1>
    <h2>Freshman year I took a web design class where I learned HTML and CSS</h2>
    <h3>Then in junior year I took AP Computer Science, where I learned the fundamentals of programming and Java</h3>
    <h4>And during high school, I messed around with making a few very bad and funny websites that were hosted by friends</h4>
    <p>But other than that I didn't work on any projects or expand my knowledge</p>
